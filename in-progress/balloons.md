# Balloon Project [*A Short Remembrance*]

## Overview

Balloons as physical markers of geographic sites of significance. A temporary remembrance. 

Large balloons draw attention; they put on a visual performance in the sky. In this regard, they are noteworthy, and they stand out, functioning as the physical incarnation of markers on a map. However, they are also impermanent, fragile, and temporary so even as they hint at the need to record and archive, they display an inablity to hold onto certain things. There's a temporality to them that is important. 

## Mapping

The most important question here is: what is being marked? 

Perhaps this is about innocent [lives lost (taken) in NYC](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/nyregion/fatal-police-encounters-in-new-york-city.html). The problem is that this could include lots of people—what about those killed on their bikes? Those killed in [recent events](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/31/new-york-police-shooting-manhattan)? Those killed by the police? (This process of sorting through them feels a bit minimizing, as well.)

What type of sites should be marked? Are there places that are unmappable? Sites where something technically relevant that happens that could be commemorated? Balloons won't be around forever, so what's something that similarly demands a poetic but ephemeral recognition? 

Until this gets answered, there's not point to doing the project.



## Materials

[Giant balloons](https://www.amazon.com/Giant-Inch-White-Water-Balloon/dp/B00CO6EZ86/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1510854727&sr=8-8&keywords=giant+balloon+60+inch) - On Amazon, about $18 each

[String](https://www.amazon.com/500-ft-200-lb-Black-Dacron-Kiteflying/dp/B06VV92VH4/ref=sr_1_10?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1510855085&sr=1-10&keywords=dacron+line) - For tying the balloons to the spots that they signify. Dacron line seems a good thing to use; it's not as flimsy as balloon string but can still be cut with a scissors, and comes in different colors and patterns,  $10-30 depending on length. 

 - it could make sense to get a type of rope that can't be cut with scissors? Worth thinking this through 

Markings - Something should be at the base of the balloon, signifying exactly what is being represented. Not sure yet what form this should take, but it could also include a map of the other locations in the city that are marked. 

## Considerations 

- Is this legal? Flying restrictions (But does it matter? As long as we set up at night.)
