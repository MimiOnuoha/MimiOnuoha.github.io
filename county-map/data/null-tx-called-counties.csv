"Fayette, TX",48149,Central Texas,y,1,,"public library - 979-968-3765 Roxanne Johnson --> local historian. she might be able to give more insight. There's a building in the mullens-prairie area. they have a picture of a two story shack. sheriff will lacime. 1920s, 30s is when he startted. 

Librarian says that Carolyn Heinson is a local historian, and she would know. Email her! caheinsohn@hotmail.com. Tell her Roxanne sent me. 

Huntsville has a prison museum. Walker county has a historical commission that may be able to help me."
"Falls, TX",48145,Central Texas,y,,0,I spoke with Sharon. She said that she did a lot of research into convict leasting when she moved there and didn't see any mentions of it happening. 
"Williamson, TX",48491,Central Texas,y,,,"she sends me to the historic courthouse. THe courthouse sends me to the judge or HR department. They send me to operator, who gives me the number to the museum: 512-943-1670.  i call them and they say to semail kconrad@williamsonmuseum.org and her name is Kathryn Conrad. "
"Burnet, TX",48053,Central Texas,y,,1,"Gave me the number to the Burnett county historical commission - 512-715-8249. called them again on 10/19, no answer. I call back on 10/25, and I speak to a man who tells me he has no idea and its his wife who is on the historical commission. he tells me to call back at 4:30 CT, which is 5:30PM ET. 

Update on 12/6: I finally get the answer I'm looking for when I find this academic article which clearly says that there was a lease on a quarry in Burnet, Texas: https://jstor.org/stable/40802015. It didn't come from calling or talking to anyone, but it counts. Note also that the men caught up in it are Mexican.  I put a 1 in the Incidence Post-Call column, but I'm not exactly sure how to categorize this one. 

Some other difficult but useful bits from the article: Scottish men were caught up in the lease, too! Even though: ""Texas prison population increased by approximately 700 percent between 1870 and 1912. Black Texans made up one-fifth of the statewide population across the lease era, but were three-fifths of its state prisoners. A typical prisoner in Texas's lease era was a young, black, illiterate male serving a first sentence for burglary or theft, and, according to historian David Oshinsky, ""his trial took place without a lawyer, in a matter of minutes, before an all-white jury prone to discount 'nigger testimony' as a pack of lies."" And the quarry was full of mostly White and Mexican convicts, because it was seen as better than railroads or plantations. This is a really good source, link again: "
"Freestone, TX",48161,Central Texas,y,,0?,"she says to call the fairfield public library. i look up their phone number, its (903) 389-3574. i call them, they say to call the museum. ask for linda mullen or patty pratt. their phone number is (903) 389-3738. i call but no one answers (10/19).

i also learn from the library that on the website they have freestone county newspapers archived back to the 1890s. Librarian says  that I could dig around on their website for more information as well. 

I call back on 10/25 and have a 15 minute long conversation with patricia pratt, who is in her 70s and gives me her whowl history. we find out that we're both from the same general parts of houston, and she's the first person i give my full name to (it feels weird not to when she asks after she's shared so much with me). after we talk for awhile, she tells me that she thinks there wasn't convict leasing in freestone because there wasn't a big prison there, just a small jail. 

i push and ask about agriculture and she tells me that cotton was a big crop there after 1836 (when TX became a republic).she also says that the county definitely had slave labor pre-the emancipation proclamation. but she still thinks that the lack of a prison means that it likely wasn't there. She also says there wasn't a convict cemetary for a fact. but she's going to dig around and ask and do some research to see if there was any convict leasing, and she takes my number and says that she'll call back once she's done that. 

patricia feels to me like someone who wouldn't be trying to hide anything. she is one of many people to mention huntsville's prison, and i learn the unsettling fact that in the 19th century they stopped hanging people there and instead executed folks by an electric chair they called ""ol sparky."" "
"Brazos, TX",48041,Central Texas,y,,,"She says to call the district clerk (instead of them, the county clerk) at 979.361.4230. i have a nice talk with victoria over there who says that she will make a few phone calls and get back to me. "
"San Saba, TX",48411,Central Texas,y,,,She gives me the library phone number: 3253723079. I call the library and they say they don't know (they haven't heard of convict leasing). She recommends that I call a bigger library who might have more resources. 
"Hill, TX",48217,Central Texas,y,,,"She says this is a district clerk question and transfers me to them. They say I can request the information through their website and someone will research it for me. The website is hillcountydc.com, I fill out a request so hopefully I'll hear back from them soon. They call back on 12/7 and say that I need to call the Hill County Jail. "
"San Jacinto, TX",48407,East Texas,y,,,"She said to call the same number but with the last four digits of 2091. I called them and the lady told me that  Dale is the person who would know, and that she'll call me back after getting in touch with him. Also told me that I should have a name attached to the number. "
"Wood, TX",48499,East Texas,y,1,,"Connected me to the library. The phone number is 9037634191. The librarian has a british accent and says: ""Absolutely no idea."" She connects me to someone from the geneology group: 903-497-6657. His name is Dee-son Hunt. He says he does not know. He says to look for Wood County Historical Commision. "
"Panola, TX",48365,East Texas,y,,0,"Transferred to judge's secretary. waiting for him to call back. I receive a call back the next day: Panola County has never been involved in it. This is one of the first sure responses! He's on the historical commission and says that in all of his research he is sure that Panola was never involved.
"
"Hopkins, TX",48223,East Texas,y,,,"connects me to genealogy: 903-885-8523. no answer, so i'll call back another day. "
"Rusk, TX",48401,East Texas,y,,,"she says to try the historical commission or the library. historical commission phone number i find online, it's (903) 657-2261. They con't answer when I call, but I find an email address i can follow up with: sjoans@aol.com"
"Bowie, TX",48037,East Texas,y,1,,she says she doesn't know but she'll connect me to someone who might. i don't get a response from them. i'm not even sure who to call back...
"San Augustine, TX",48405,East Texas,y,,0?,"she says to call the historical building at the old jail. but then she says that the office doesnt have a phone number. Instead she gives me the phone number to Neil Murphy, the man who runs the historical society. His number: 936-275-9033. Someone else answers his phone and tells me to call 936-275-6986. He has never heard of convict leasing before. He encourages me to come and visit the library across from First Baptist Church. I look it up on Google Maps and find that the phone number is +19362755367. So I give them a call. They tell me to call back tomorrow, when Mary Francis the geneologist will be there and I can ask her. On 12/6 she calls me back and says that all she can find are German prisoners who were there in 1944-1946, and they weren't leased out they worked in the forest service in a lot of the surrounding areas. "

"Rockwall, TX",48397,North Texas,y,,,no response
"Wilbarger, TX",48487,North Texas,y,,,She says that she doesn't know how they could even verify this. She said it's not something she's heard of but she's only been working there about three years and she doesn't think that they can go far back enough to verify. 
"Johnson, TX",48251,North Texas,y,,,extension: 6970 for genealogy i think? she says that they have convicts who come out to the courthuose and put up the christmas decorations now. they do work now and get time off their parole. she gives me the sherif's office number: 817-556-6060. she doesn't even know who to refer me to. 
"Fannin, TX",48147,North Texas,y,,0,"she tells me to call bonham historical commission. i find their number at 903-583-5947 and have a really nice talk with larry standley about fannin county history. he tells me 1.) that he has lived in fannin since the 1960s and his great great great grandfather lived in fannin back in 1836 when texas was still part of mexico. he's been on the historical commission for a long time and he's never heard a thing about convict leasing. 2.) fannin county was one of the counties that voted against secession, so its very likely that fannin didn't have it. I wonder if i sho"

On 12/1 they call me back and tell me that I should email them at wisemuseum@embarqmail.com"
"Clay, TX",48077,North Texas,y,,,"She says to call the sheriff's department, and also says that she has no idea. She takes my phone number and says she'll ask the county clerk to give me a call tomorrow when they come back in town but if they don't call it's because they don't know the answer. "
"Archer, TX",48009,North Texas,y,,,"The first person says she is going to connect me to the clerk bc she doesn't know what CL is, and then she accidentally hangs up on me. The county clerk says its the first time she has ever heard this question. she says that they have a library and a young woman who is trying to get the musuem back up and running. She gives me that person's name and phone number: Callie Lawson 9405744569. Callie doesn't answer when I call. "
"Navarro, TX",48349,North Texas,y,,,"I get a pre-recorded ansering machine that gives me a confusing list of options, so I decide to just look up the Corsicana public library and give them a call directly at (903) 654-4810. They connect me to Dana over at genealogy, who tells me that I can go to newspaper.com and find stories about a farm in Corsicana where convicts would work at to pay their bail. I go to newspaper.com and find this: https://www.newspapers.com/image/12001967/?clipping_id=18855427&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjEyMDAxOTY3LCJpYXQiOjE3MDE4ODI4NTksImV4cCI6MTcwMTk2OTI1OX0.4-oY_W0rXSEx9NfYRCXRXU0xyUm6M9nrebOXa_h4RtE It's talking about prison labor, but I'm not sure that it's actually convict leasing as a opposed to just regular prison labor. I'll run it by Patrick."
"Lipscomb, TX",48295,Panhandle,y,,,Told me to call Wolf Creek heritage museum in lipscomb (lip-scumb). I called them at 806-653-2131 and didn't get a response. 
"Wheeler, TX",48483,Panhandle,y,,,"""I've never heard of that, so it must not have been a thing."" "
"Childress, TX",48075,Panhandle,y,,,"She had no idea, so she directed me to call the local jack of all trades (who I believe also works for the county?) named Greg Buckley. His phone number is 9409376158.  "
"Parmer, TX",48369,Panhandle,y,,,"she has no idea. transfers me to the parmer county judges office. there is no one there, so they don't call back. "
"Sherman, TX",48421,Panhandle,y,,0,"judge's office. 806-366-2021 judge carter. the judge says, very definitively, that they never had convict leasing there. i have a really lovely conversation with the woman who works there. i learn that they have a history museum and that the county is pretty much just generational agriculture. they grow cotton, corn, sorghum, etc. 

when she tells me that they grew cotton and corn, i take pause. these are crops that would almost certainly have had slave labor, no? and sherman county is right at the top of the state, below the oklahoma panhandle, which only exists because texas wasn't allowed to have slaves in that area. basically: can i trust what any of these people are saying? why do i believe the judge? I do so much to make it easy for folks to talk about this, but in doing so am i also making it easy for them to not talk about it? 
"
"Gray, TX",48179,Panhandle,y,,,"i call on 10/25. the woman i speak with goes to check her historical book and says that she doesn't see any mention of it. but she also suggests that i call the local musuem, which is the white deer land musuem - 806-669-8041. I call them on 10/25 and don't get any response."
"Swisher, TX",48437,Panhandle,y,,0?,"she gives me the phone number to the museum and the library. the museum: 806-995-2819. library is 806-995-3447. I get no response from the museum. the librarian says she hasn't heard anything about it. She connects me to Bob at the museum (I don't know how she's able to get him on the phone, they must be close by each other). He knows for a fact that they did have it recently bc he worked at the prison. But the little penitentiary thats in town came about in the 90s, and I'm talking about more historically. He says that the county wasn't incorporated until 1890, and if I want to know what they did with the prisoners in the county prison then I might need to call the courthouse to get some older records.  

I end up doing some of my own follow up research and find this history of the county: https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/swisher-county Based on it, I think its pretty fair to say that there probably wasn't any convict leasing going down in the county."
"Dallam, TX",48111,Panhandle,y,,,"I call but get no response. IT doesn't even look like they accept calls? Need to revisit this, maybe look up a historical society to see what I can find."
"Deaf Smith, TX",48117,Panhandle,y,,,she refers me to the museum (but doesn't give me their phone number). Deaf Smith County Museum doesn't answer when I call. Might need to get Nwao to call them back.
"Jim Hogg, TX",48247,South Texas,y,,,busy line. says to try again later
"Edwards, TX",48137,South Texas,y,,0,"judges office. 830-683-6122. they had a ""lil ol bitty jail"" and no one was ever even kept in it so they didn't do that that much. he says no! "
"Gillespie, TX",48171,South Texas,y,,0,"Says to call the Gillespie county historical society. pioneer museum. 830-997-2835. ""I started working here as a volunteer in 2003 and I've never heard anyone mention convict leasing."" But she says that there is a good case to believe that convict leasing didn't happen in Gillespie: the county was against succession. Out of somewhere around 400 votes, there were only 17 people who voted for secession. So probably no one hired convicts after the war. She's a native, has volunteered since 2003, and says she has never heard anyone mention convict leasing. "
"La Salle, TX",48283,South Texas,y,,,Says that I should give Ana a call back tomorrow. But I need to sniff up the phone number for the deeds office
"Live Oak, TX",48297,South Texas,y,,0,"she transfered me to the county judges office. they transferred me to Nancy Toquat, at 3617862706. i left a messdage on her home machine. Nancy followed up with me on 11/13, telling me that she had followed up with multiple people who were very well-versed in the county's history and no one could verify it. She thinks that they didn't have convict leasing in Live Oak. "
"Zapata, TX",48505,South Texas,y,,0?,"she transfers me to the county clerk at 956-765-9915. they are stumped and give me the phone number for the museum: 956-765-8983. i call the museum and they connect me to Jaime Gonzales, who she says is pretty familiar with the county's history. his number is 956-763-4818. i give him a call right after. he tells me that he doesn't think that they had it there. i ask him why and he says that the county is tiny and didn't even have a jail at that time. i ask him what the industries of the area would have been then and he says farming (corn, beans, watermelon) and ranching. "
"Maverick, TX",48323,South Texas,y,,,"They are gonna give me a call back tomorrow, but they also recommend that I call the library. I'm gonna wait to see if I get a call back and if not, I'll dig up the library's phone number and give them a call. "
"Kendall, TX",48259,South Texas,y,,,"I call but get no response at all. I think I've missed the opening hours, so I will have to call back."
"Kenedy, TX",48261,South Texas,y,,0?,"She transfers me to the district clerk. She says that she doesn't think they did bc she's been there 32 years and never heard of it, and she worked with the woman who was district clerk ahead of her and had never said anything about it. So she thinks it's a no. I do a preliminary internet search and don't see anything about it in kenedy."
"Waller, TX",48473,Upper Gulf Coast,y,,,"On the clerk's advice, I called the Waller county historical society 2819342826. Apparently the number has been disconnected. Instead, I think I need to email them, which I can do on their website. Waller county historical society and commission. wallercountyhistory.org. The website has some interesting information here: "
"Chambers, TX",48071,Upper Gulf Coast,y,,,She was a little snooty and didn't seem to want to talk. Not nearly as friendly as some of the other counties that I called. But she also said she had never heard of convict leasing. 
"Galveston, TX",48167,Upper Gulf Coast,y,1,,(10/18) lots of calling. no answer.  On 10/25 I decide to call the Galveston and Texas History Center within the Rosenberg library at 409.763.8854. No answer. I need to call back and ask to be connected to the Galveston and Texas History Center. 
"Matagorda, TX",48321,Upper Gulf Coast,y,,,Matagorda County Museum. She says that I should look them up on google bc they have weird hours but they might be able to help. Their number is (979) 245-7502
"Montgomery, TX",48339,Upper Gulf Coast,y,,,Texas department of critical research. THere's a prison in huntsville that is worth talking to. less than a mile from the downtown square. call the prison museum. so i call them at (936) 295-2155 to ask if huntsville used convict leasing. she gives me david's number and he is going to get back to me next week (i call them on 10/18)
"Colorado, TX",48089,Upper Gulf Coast,y,,0,"they say to call the local nesabit memorial libray online or the texas state library in austin. i go on the library's website and find this link to an intense overview of colorado county history. i spend a long time reading the sections after the civil war. it's clear that the county didn't have convict leasing. It's also clear that life was so ad hoc in that moment. they didn't have convict leasing, but there are clear examples of former slaveholders saying that they will pay the formerly enslaved who worked for them but then refusing to. they weren't convicts, but it wasn't that different, was it? 
10/18"
"Liberty, TX",48291,Upper Gulf Coast,y,,1,"She tells me to call the Sam Houston Regional Library because thye have a lot of documents and records from the courthouse. they have books from 1876 and prior. she says i could come and look but the library might have a copy of everything. i look up the library phone number and its: (936) 336-8821. i call them. 

Sandra at the Sam Houston Regional Library gives the first absolutely certain yes. She says that Liberty County did have convict leasing! and she knows it beecause she found the information in census records. The family worked on the plantation in the early 1900s. she just happened to stumble upon the information because the people were listed on the census as convict leased (and it was the ancestors of a friend whose family wouldn't give him answers about the family history). This was in Liberty County! she tells me to email samhoustoncenter@tsl.texas.gov to get the records.

This was another really good phone call. (10/25)."
"Walker, TX",48471,Upper Gulf Coast,y,1,1,"They don't have records but the Walker County Historical Commission (936.435.2497 address 1301 Sam Houston Avenue room 218 huntsville TX 77340) or the Huntsville Public Library has some of them. I call the Historic Commission and don't get a response, so I look up the number for the Huntsville Public Library instead, which is: 936-291-5472. They transfer me to Toni in the Genealogy room. She says she would almost bet that it was yes. She says that if youve done any research you've seen convicts working out in fields protected by men on horseback. She said that's what they used in prisons, and they did lease out the labor. She says back then they didn't have a budget for the prison system. But now the prison is partially self-sufficient, but back then that wasn't any kind of plan that they had. So she would almost bet that they did just to make ends meet. And in a lot of historical books you'll see the convicts working and the things that you see there are not things the prison would have had. 

She tells me that if I have any further questions I should go to the Prison Museum and she gives me directions to get there that I will probably not use: that I need to jump on I-45 going north, and the prison has a museum. Old 75 is the name of the road. It's the road for ther Old 75 highway, she says go between HEB and Walgreens going north then I can go off of it and then once I see I-45 on my left, then I can find the Veteran's Museum, the HArt's Museumn, and the Prison's Museum. "
"Brazoria, TX",48039,Upper Gulf Coast,y,1,1,"(i start this recording late). the clerk's office doesn't know but they say they can giveme the number. she hangs up on me before she can give me the number for the historical department: 9798641208. the number they give me connects me ot the museum, and they instead connect me to a librarian: 9798641503. she says yes. There's an extensive history of convict leasing in Brazoria County. She names Retrieve Plantation, which was a plantation and then turned into a jail. (Retrieve farm, then retrieve unit). Darrington Plantation, then turned into Darrington Units. And then the Clemens system, which was similar. Brazoria was Stephen F Austin's county and plantation. There were dozens of big plantations in the area and nearly all of them are turned into jails or prisons that then had convict leasing. 

This was a great call, one of the ones where we got confimred what we wanted to confirm. "
"Wharton, TX",48481,Upper Gulf Coast,y,,0?,"I get connected to the county clerk, Barbara Swath (?), who has been around for a very long time. She says she doesn't know. But she connects me to the museum: 9795322600. i call them and she says that she only knows about world war 2 german prisoners of war (note that the prisoners were housed in prisons). she says she thinks its a no because before there's no record of it and she's never heard of it. 

Wharton Count is a real important one for us; if it becomes a no or a 0 it's a huge one because it borders Fort bend County and Harris County, which we know for a fact had convict leasing. So I keep digging, and I find this overview on Wharton: https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/wharton-county. It doesn't mention convict leasing, and in fact a lot of farmland in the county is turned to cattle ranching land after the Civil War and a good amount of residents leave. But at the same time, the article on Cotton barely mentions the labor of enslaved people, which leads me to think that there could be other absences. Compare this to how thorough the Colorado County records are, for instance! "
"Jeff Davis, TX",48243,West Texas,y,,,

"Hudspeth, TX",48229,West Texas,y,,,he says I should call judge mckinsey and they might know. phone number is 915.369.2321. i call them and they say that the judge is out and that they will call me back. they also say that i can call them back after 10/28.
"Dickens, TX",48125,West Texas,y,,,"She transferred me to the county judge, who isn't in. Instead I talked to the secretary. Secretary has no idea so she connects me to the local public library at 806-271-3714. Librarian hasn't heard of it. She does a search in their books to see what comes up. Nothing comes up in the search. She passes me along to the local historian at Spur-Dickens Museum (actual name is Dickens County Museum ). Their hours are Friday from 1-5, Saturday from 10 to 1pm and their phone number is 806 294 5401, so I have to wait til Friday to give them a call."
"Kimble, TX",48267,West Texas,y,,,"she suggests calling the Kimble County Historical Museum at 325.446.4219. they aren't open everyday but she says they should have the answer. They don't answer the phone call, though they're supposed to be open. I'll have to call them back."
"Floyd, TX",48153,West Texas,y,,,"no response when I call. looks like I called outside of the hours. I call back on 12/6 and they tell me to call the Floyd County Museum. I look up their number and it's 806/983-2415, I call and get no answer. I'll pass this one over to Nwao."
"Yoakum, TX",48501,West Texas,y,,0?,"I call the county clerk's office. they connect me to the library at 806-456-8725. they say that they don't really know. they'll ask around and if they call me back it means they found something, and if they didn't it means they got nothing. THey call me back on 12/7 and say that they're pretty sure that it didn't happen here. I ask them how they know and they say that it's a small town so they can just ask people who are the grandkids and the great grandkids of folks who have been in town for awhile. They also encouraged me to check out Brownfield, which does further my sense that the county may not have had convict leasing: https://brownfieldchamber.com/2018/09/27/history-of-brownfield/"
